<h1>Experiment No. 2 on Some semantic elements used in HTML 5 and their functions. </h1>
    <h2>Web Programming</h2>
<body>
  <header>
    With HTML4, developers used their own id/class names to style elements: header, top, bottom, footer, menu, navigation, main, container, content, article, sidebar, topnav, etc.
This made it impossible for search engines to identify the correct web page content.
With the new HTML5 elements (&lt;header&gt; &lt;footer&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;article&gt;), this will become easier.
A Semantic Web Allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities.
    <nav>nav (short for navigation) element -The &lt;nav&gt;element defines a set of navigation links.</nav>
  </header>
  <section>
    A &lt;section&gt; is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
    <article>ARTICLE TAG</article>
    <article>The &lt;article&gt; element specifies independent, self-contained content.</article>
    <article>An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.</article>
  </section>
    <div>The &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The &lt;div&gt; tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.</div>
  <aside>
    The &lt;aside&gt; element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
    The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.
